The first version of this framework focuses on the creation of dashboard style desktop applications, defining a component based architecture. As a result, you have a product divided into small functional parts called a module or plugin. Each module of the application injects its elements of view and incorporates new functionalities. Creating applications in this way is quite simple, therefore, the business and development models for these products are very flexible.
